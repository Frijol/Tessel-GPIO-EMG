Tessel-GPIO-EMG-Module
======================

Example code for the EMG module for Tessel's GPIO port.

This code is intended for use with specific hardware, wired to electrodes on the bicep.

test.js prints the output from channels 1 and 2 of the GPIO module.

strength-meter.js turns a servo in proportion to the output from channel 2.

#Servo
Driver for the servo-pca9685 Tessel servo module ([PCA9685](http://www.nxp.com/documents/data_sheet/PCA9685.pdf)), capable of driving up to 16 servos at once. Can also be used to drive other devices which accept a 3.3 V PWM signal (most motor controllers, LEDs, gate drivers, etc.).

## TODO

This can be used with LEDs also and this package is very narrowly named.

##Installation
```sh
npm install servo-pca9685
```

##Example
```js
/*********************************************
This servo module demo turns the servo around
~18 degrees every 500ms, then resets it after
10 turns, reading out position to the console
at each movement.
*********************************************/

var tessel = require('tessel');
var servo = require('servo-pca9685');

var hardware = tessel.port('A');

// Initialize the servo.
console.log('Initalizing...');

var servoController = servo.use(hardware);

servoController.on('ready', function () {
  var pos = 0;  //  Target position of the servo between 0 (min) and 1 (max).

  //  Set the minimum and maximum duty cycle for servo 1.
  //  If the servo doesn't move to its full extent or stalls out
  //  and gets hot, try tuning these values (0.05 and 0.12).
  //  Moving them towards each other = less movement range
  //  Moving them apart = more range, more likely to stall and burn out
  servoController.configureServo(1, 0.05, 0.12, function () {
    setInterval(function () {
      console.log('% of full rotation:', pos);
      //  Set servo #1 to position pos.
      servoController.move(1, pos);

      // Increment by 10% (~18 deg for a normal servo)
      pos += 0.1;
      if (pos > 1) {
        pos = 0;
      }
    }, 500);
  });
});
```

##Methods

##### * `servo.configure(whichServo, minPWM, maxPWM, callback())` Sets the PWM max and min for the specified servo.

##### * `servo.move(whichServo, positionOrSpeed, callback())` `positionOrSpeed` is a value between 0 and 1. On a normal servo, this value is the position to move to as a percent of the total available rotational range. On a continuous rotation servo, this value represents the rotation speed: 0 is fast in one direction, 1 is fast in the other direction, and 0.5 is stopped.

##### * `servo.read(whichServo, callback())` Reads the current approximate position target for the specified servo.

##### * `servo.setDutyCycle(whichServo, on, callback())` Sets the duty cycle for the specified servo. `on` is duty cycle uptime, range from 0-1.

##### * `servo.setModuleFrequency(Hertz, callback())` Sets the PWM frequency in Hz for the PCA9685 chip.

##Events

##### * `servo.on('error', callback(err))` Emitted upon error.

##### * `servo.on('ready', callback())` Emitted upon first successful communication between the Tessel and the module.

##Hardware/Advanced usage

*  The servos used in conjunction with this module should be powered through the 5.5 mm barrel jack.
*  The physical *module* is marked with "S", "+", and "-". These correspond to signal, power, and GND. On most *servos*, the GND wire will be black/brown and the signal wire will be yellow/white. Red typically denotes 5 V power.
*  This module can be used to drive most speed controllers, which in turn can control a wide variety of actuators. It can also be used to drive small LEDs with current limiting resistors in series.
*  The bare square pads by the barrel jack allow the addition of a capacitor to the input power rail if desired. The pad closest to the board edge is connected to GND, the other to the barrel jack's positive pin. This addition is not required for proper module functionality.
